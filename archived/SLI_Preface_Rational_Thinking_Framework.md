The goal of this article is to offer a **framework for rational thinking about the impact of artificial intelligence** — one that moves beyond ideology, hype, or fear. As AI accelerates productivity, transforms labor, and redefines wealth creation, it also challenges the balance that sustains societies. Rather than treating technology as inherently good or bad, this framework seeks to **quantify and reason through its systemic effects** on employment, income distribution, energy demand, and social equity. The **Sustainable Life Index (SLI)** is proposed as a model for evidence-based reasoning — a disciplined method to evaluate whether the rapid advance of AI contributes to sustainable human equilibrium or destabilizes it.
