This paper examines both the **additive** and **multiplicative** formulations of the Sustainable Life Index (SLI).  
The **additive model** serves as the analytical baseline, providing a first-order approximation that enables transparent sensitivity analysis and straightforward empirical application.  
The **multiplicative model**, by contrast, captures interdependence and nonlinearity among components — reflecting how weakness in one domain can diminish the sustainability of the whole system.  

Together, these complementary perspectives offer a more complete understanding of how technological, social, and environmental forces interact under accelerating AI-driven change, setting the foundation for future exploration of **hybrid and dynamic equilibrium models**.
