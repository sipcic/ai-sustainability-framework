Technological progress, particularly in **automation and artificial intelligence (AI)**, is rapidly reshaping the foundations of economic productivity and social organization. Global output continues to rise, yet indicators of **well-being, equality, and environmental stability** are increasingly decoupled from traditional measures of growth such as GDP or productivity per worker.  

The goal of this article is to offer a **framework for rational thinking about the impact of artificial intelligence** — one that moves beyond ideology, hype, or fear. As AI accelerates productivity, transforms labor, and redefines wealth creation, it also challenges the balance that sustains societies. Rather than treating technology as inherently good or bad, this framework seeks to **quantify and reason through its systemic effects** on employment, income distribution, energy demand, and social equity.  

To achieve this, we introduce the **Sustainable Life Index (SLI)** — a composite model designed to quantify the balance between **economic productivity, social inclusion, and ecological integrity**. The SLI links six interdependent variables, each representing a necessary pillar of sustainable life, and provides a disciplined, evidence-based method for evaluating whether the rapid advance of AI contributes to sustainable human equilibrium or destabilizes it.  

This raises a fundamental question:  
> **Can we define and measure progress in a way that remains aligned with the sustainability of life itself?**
