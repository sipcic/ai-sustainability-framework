### Mathematical Definition of Dynamic Equilibrium

Mathematically, equilibrium is expressed as:  

$$
\frac{d(\text{SLI})}{dt} = \sum_i \frac{\partial \text{SLI}}{\partial x_i}\frac{dx_i}{dt} \approx 0
$$

From a **total derivative perspective**, this condition means that the **combined rate of change** of all components of the Sustainable Life Index balances out over time:  

$$
\frac{d(\text{SLI})}{dt}
  = \sum_i \frac{\partial \text{SLI}}{\partial x_i}\frac{dx_i}{dt}
$$

where each $x_i \in \{L_r, C_r, W_r, R, E_r, G\}$ represents a sustainability dimension — **employment**, **consumption**, **income equity**, **renewable share**, **emissions**, and **inequality**.  

In equilibrium, **positive contributions** (e.g., from renewable expansion $\frac{dR}{dt} > 0$) offset **negative ones** (e.g., from declining labor participation $\frac{dL_r}{dt} < 0$), so that the net change in sustainability remains near zero.  

This formulation clarifies that sustainability is not static; it reflects a **vector balance of temporal change** across interdependent domains.  
If any one term dominates — for instance, rapid AI-induced productivity growth ($\frac{dW_r}{dt}$) without corresponding social or ecological compensation — the total derivative becomes negative, signaling systemic drift away from equilibrium.  

Hence, the equilibrium condition $\frac{d(\text{SLI})}{dt} \approx 0$ defines a **dynamic synchronization** among technological, social, and environmental subsystems — not their constancy, but their **coordinated co-evolution** in time.
