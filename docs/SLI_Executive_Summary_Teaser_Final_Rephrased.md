# Executive Summary (Teaser)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing faster than the systems designed to guide it. Productivity soars, yet **inequality widens**, **energy demand grows**, and **societies struggle to keep pace**. The world risks gaining intelligence while losing balance.

We introduce the **Sustainable Life Index (SLI)** — a rational, quantitative framework for assessing whether technological progress, particularly AI, enhances or undermines the equilibrium of life systems:

$$
\text{SLI} = f(L_r, C_r, W_r, R, E_r, G)
$$

The SLI unites six interdependent forces — **employment** $(L_r)$, **consumption adequacy** $(C_r)$, **income equity** $(W_r)$, **renewable energy share** $(R)$, **emission burden** $(E_r)$, and **inequality** $(G)$ — into a single composite measure of sustainability.
It provides a **language for reasoning about how economic, social, and ecological systems co-evolve under AI-driven acceleration**.

The paper defines sustainability not as an endpoint but as a **living, dynamic equilibrium**, expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{d(\text{SLI})}{dt} \approx 0
$$

This equilibrium endures only when **productivity**, **justice**, and **ecology evolve together**. When AI’s acceleration exceeds society’s adaptive capacity, the derivative turns negative: **jobs vanish** ($L_r↓$), **wages stagnate** ($W_r↓$), **inequality deepens** ($G↑$), and **emissions surge** ($E_r↑$).

To understand and quantify this balance, the paper explores both **additive** and **multiplicative** models of equilibrium — capturing linear trade-offs as well as the nonlinear interdependencies that define sustainable progress in the age of AI.

The paper concludes with a warning that unchecked imbalance will not end civilization in an instant — it will **erode it gradually**, as coherence, purpose, and collective control fade.

The **Sustainable Life Index (SLI)** emerges as more than a model; it is a rational compass for guiding humanity through the accelerating tide of artificial intelligence — transforming sustainability from an ideal into an operational architecture of survival.

> **We must govern intelligence before intelligence governs us.**

The urgency is clear: only by **embedding equilibrium into innovation itself can humanity ensure that AI’s evolution amplifies life’s continuity — not its collapse.**
