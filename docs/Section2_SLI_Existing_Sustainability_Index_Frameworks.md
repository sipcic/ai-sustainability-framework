# 2. Existing Sustainability Index Frameworks

The concept of sustainability measurement has evolved through multiple generations of composite indicators, each seeking to capture the balance between economic performance, social well-being, and ecological integrity. This section summarizes the main approaches that inform — and contrast with — the proposed **Sustainable Life Index (SLI)**.

## 2.1 Historical Evolution of Sustainability Indices

The earliest attempts to move beyond GDP began in the late 20th century with the development of **Human Development Index (HDI)** and **Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)**. These indices introduced **multi-dimensional metrics** for human welfare, combining economic and social factors. Subsequent frameworks increasingly incorporated **environmental constraints**, leading to modern composite indices of sustainable development.

Over time, sustainability indices have diversified into three main streams:
1. **Well-being–centric** indices (e.g., HDI, Happy Planet Index)  
2. **Ecological–economic** models (e.g., Ecological Footprint, Environmental Performance Index)  
3. **Integrated policy indices** (e.g., Sustainable Development Index, OECD’s Better Life Index)

While valuable, these models often treat economic, social, and environmental pillars as separable — without explicit modeling of the dynamic interactions among **technology, labor, and energy** that now define the 21st-century economy.

## 2.2 Representative Frameworks

### (a) Happy Planet Index (HPI) – New Economics Foundation
**Purpose:** Measures the extent to which nations deliver sustainable well-being.  
**Formula (simplified):**
$$
\text{HPI} = \frac{\text{Well-being} \times \text{Life Expectancy}}{\text{Ecological Footprint}}
$$
**Key Variables:** life satisfaction, life expectancy, ecological footprint.  
**Limitations:** Omits employment, income distribution, and productivity structure — all central to long-term economic resilience.

---

### (b) Sustainable Development Index (SDI) – Hickel (2019)
**Purpose:** Adjusts the Human Development Index by ecological impact.  
$$
\text{SDI} = \frac{\text{HDI}}{\text{Ecological Footprint}}
$$
**Key Variables:** life expectancy, education, income (HDI components), ecological footprint.  
**Limitations:** Focuses on per capita outcomes rather than systemic drivers such as automation, energy transition, or labor share.

---

### (c) Environmental Performance Index (EPI) – Yale and Columbia Universities
**Purpose:** Evaluates national environmental health and ecosystem vitality.  
**Key Variables:** climate policy, biodiversity, pollution, water and sanitation.  
**Limitations:** Environmental scope is strong, but EPI is not designed to integrate economic or social dimensions of sustainability.

---

### (d) Better Life Index (BLI) – OECD
**Purpose:** Provides a multi-dimensional measure of well-being across OECD countries.  
**Key Variables:** income, jobs, housing, education, environment, civic engagement.  
**Limitations:** Highly comprehensive but **non-normative**; lacks weighting grounded in ecological constraints.

---

### (e) Integrated Sustainability Models – Motesharrei et al. (2016)
**Purpose:** Simulates interactions among population, inequality, consumption, and environment using system-dynamics models.  
**Method:** Nonlinear coupled differential equations.  
**Limitations:** Theoretical and simulation-based — not formulated as a composite measurable index.

## 2.3 Comparison with the Sustainable Life Index (SLI)

| Feature / Index | HPI | SDI | EPI | BLI | System Models | **SLI (Proposed)** |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----------------|--------------------|
| Economic inclusion (Employment, Income) | Partial | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | Partial | **✓** |
| Social equity (Inequality) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Environmental sustainability | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Energy transition (Renewables) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Productivity / Automation coupling | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | **✓** |
| Explicit mathematical model | Simplified | Simplified | None | None | Dynamic | **Formal additive & multiplicative equations** |

The **SLI** distinguishes itself by explicitly modeling **the feedback loop between automation, labor, and energy** — a relationship that current sustainability metrics do not quantify.  
By integrating labor participation, median income, renewable share, and emissions within a unified mathematical framework, the SLI bridges **economic system modeling** and **sustainability assessment**.

## 2.4 Positioning and Contribution

The Sustainable Life Index builds upon existing indices but introduces three conceptual advancements:
1. **Integration of Technological Dynamics:** Explicitly links AI/Automation and productivity growth to labor demand, income distribution, and energy use.  
2. **Dynamic Equilibrium Perspective:** Treats sustainability as an ongoing balance between technological efficiency and social-ecological capacity.  
3. **Analytical Transparency:** Provides both additive (linear) and multiplicative (nonlinear) mathematical forms suitable for sensitivity analysis and empirical calibration.

The SLI therefore complements — rather than replaces — prior sustainability indices by addressing a structural gap: the absence of an integrated framework capturing **AI-driven productivity, labor participation, and ecological boundaries** as co-determinants of sustainable life.
